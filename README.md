### 🛠️ **Technologies & Tools**

- **Languages**: PHP, Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, LaTeX

- **Frameworks**: Laravel, Django, Apache Spark, LangChain, React, Vue

- **Tools**: Pandas, Polars, Git, ElasticSearch

### 🚀 **Projects**

**Ensemble of fine-tuned LLMs for hate speech recognition** - _Artificial Intelligence_

I worked in a team of three to fine-tune three different LLMs: GPT2, BERT and XLNET. These models were then used in an ensemble to increase the accuracy on the _hate speech detection_ task.

**Lymphoma detection using data-augmentation techniques** - _Deep Learning_

I worked in a team of three to find a new technique of data-augmentation on images. This technique was later used on a convolutional neural network to increase the accuracy for the _lymphoma detection_ task.

**Automatic parking space detection from surveillance camera** - _Computer vision_

I worked in a team of three to recognize and classify parking spaces automatically from a video of a low resolution camera (typical of surveillance cameras).

### 🎯 **Future goals**

As a graduating student in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, my goal is to contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent systems and real-world applications.

### ⭐ **Personal Interests**

I’m deeply intrigued by Artificial Intelligence as it excites me with its ability to push the boundaries of what we can create and achieve. I am also fascinated by astronomy, it is a humbling reminder of how small we are in the vast expanse of the universe. Both fields inspire me in their own way—one by showing how far we can go, and the other by revealing how much there is still to explore.
